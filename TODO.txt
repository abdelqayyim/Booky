Todo:
  - When a user row is clicked, show a popup so provider can view info and/or contact user
  - Work On notification page
  - 
  
Done:



Keep in mind:
  - Should only be able to a week's schedule to up 3 months in advance


Ideas:
  - Have a way for users to subscribed to a provider
  - Have a way for providers to have promotions (then notify users)
  


  I am working on a service application, the application does the following:

For User:

1 - User are able to browse services near them (haircuts, cleaning...)

2 - They can book a service (time, location , price etc...)

3 - Users can even subscribe to a service with a provider for example a haircut every 2 weeks with a specific provice

For Providers:

1 - They can accept service requests (or reschedule or cancel)
